# Submitting your final project

To submit your final project, just send the instructor the URL of your project's github repository.
If you set the repository to be *private*, then you may need to grant the instructor access to the repository.

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you make your project's repository public unless you are sufficiently experienced with github's user permission system.
